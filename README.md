# Novadocta

This is my fist web built from scratch witch HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and hopefully some JS in a near future. Novadocta is a local educational startup focused on deliver quality legal science content, adapting to this new reality going fully remote and online live lessons. My job here is to build a custom stitched Learning Management System to replace the current platform based on Worpress and Sensei LMS.
